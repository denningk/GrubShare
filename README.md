# GrubShare

Fixing food insecurity by bridging the gap between restaurants and food banks.

To run GrubShare, unzip the folder and in the command line, type: python manage.py runserver

Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (localhost), which will take you to the landing page.

From here, you have the option to log in as a Food Bank or a Restaurant. If you don't have an account with GrubShare, you can sign up quickly and easily.

Logging in as a Restaurant will take you to the Donation Form where Restaurants can describe what surplus food they will donate today as well as an approximation of how many people it will feed.

Logging in as a Food Bank will take you to a dashboard where you can see an ESRI map of restaurants donating food today, as well as the shortest route among them for the Food Bank driver. Underneath the map is a description of what restaurants are donating what kind of food as well as how many people this will serve.

With 49 million Americans living in food insecurity and 70 billion pounds of food wasted annually, we feel that this is a problem we can fix. GrubShare aims to help those in food security while reducing the amount of food waste we produce by connecting restaurants with surplus food with food banks who aim to feed those who can not afford a meal.
